tech stack :-
        is the combination of technologies used to develop an application. 
        It includes the frontend (React, Vue.js, Angular), backend (Node.js, Spring Boot, Django), 
        database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), API (REST, GraphQL), and hosting (AWS, Firebase, Vercel).
        Each layer plays a role in ensuring the app functions efficiently.

OS:-
        An OS (Operating System) manages hardware, software, and system resources.
        Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. It handles processes, memory,
        security, and user interaction.
  
UI :-

        UI refers to the visual and interactive elements of an application that users interact with.
        In a tech stack, the UI layer is usually part of the front-end and is built using:
                1- Markup & Styling:-

                        HTML (structure)
                        CSS (styling)
                        Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap (CSS frameworks)

                2- JavaScript Frameworks/Libraries
                        React.js
                        Vue.js
                        ANGULAR
                        Svelte

BACKEND:
        Backend refers to the server-side of an application, handling logic, database interactions,
        and API communication. It processes requests, manages data, and ensures security.
        Common backend technologies include Node.js, Spring Boot, Django, and Express.js, 
        with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

        java Spring Boot Microservices is an architectural approach where applications are built as a 
        collection of small, independent services. Spring Boot simplifies microservice development by 
        providing features like embedded servers, auto-configuration, and minimal boilerplate code. 
        It integrates well with Spring Cloud for service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. 
        Microservices communicate via REST APIs, gRPC, or messaging systems like Kafka. They offer scalability, 
        flexibility, and faster deployment, making them ideal for modern cloud-based applications.

API:-
    API (Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software applications to communicate with each other.
    APIs allow systems to send and receive data in a structured manner.

    Types of APIs:

       1- REST API (Representational State Transfer) – Uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and typically returns JSON.

       2- SOAP API (Simple Object Access Protocol) – Uses XML for messaging and is more structured.

       3- GraphQL API – Allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching.

        4- WebSockets – For real-time communication (e.g., chat applications).

    APIs in a Tech Stack:-

        APIs are used in both frontend and backend development:

        Backend (API providers) – Spring Boot (Java), Node.js (Express), Django (Python), etc.

        Frontend (API consumers) – React, Vue.js, Angular, etc., fetching data via fetch or Axios.

DATABASE:-
        DB (Database) is a structured collection of data used for storing, managing,
        and retrieving information efficiently. It can be relational (SQL) like MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
        and Oracle, or non-relational (NoSQL) like MongoDB and Cassandra.
         Databases are essential for backend systems, enabling secure and scalable data handling in applications.

KAFKA:
        Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used for real-time data processing, 
        messaging, and communication between microservices. 
        It enables high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streaming. 
        Kafka consists of Producers (send data), Topics (store data), Consumers (receive data), and 
        Brokers (manage communication). It is widely used for log aggregation, event-driven architectures, 
        real-time analytics, and microservices communication.

ENVIRONMENT:-
        Environment in software development refers to the setup where applications run and are tested. 
        Common environments include:

        Development (Dev) – For coding and testing by developers.

        Testing (QA/Staging) – For quality assurance and bug fixes.

        Production (Prod) – The live environment where users interact with the application.

        Each environment has different configurations, such as database connections, API keys, and logging levels, to ensure stability and security.

DOCKER:-
        Docker is a containerization platform that packages applications with dependencies for consistency across environments.
        It enables portability, scalability, and efficiency. 
        Key components include Dockerfile (build instructions), Images (templates), Containers (runtime instances), 
        and Docker Compose (multi-container management).

Kubernetes (K8s):-
        Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates deployment, 
        scaling, and management of containerized applications. It handles load balancing, self-healing, 
        and resource allocation, making it ideal for microservices and cloud-native applications.
        Key components include Pods (smallest deployable units), Nodes (compute resources), and 
        Services (networking for communication).
