--- Time Complexity 
        -- Time complexity measures the time taken by an algorithm based on the length of input.
        - Usage:
             --  Used to compare the efficiency of different algorithms.
             -- Helps determine the best algorithm when multiple solutions exist.

--- Big O Notation
        --Big O notation defines the upper bound of an algorithm's time complexity, 
           showing the maximum time an algorithm could take for a given input size.
        --Big O notation helps to ignore hardware speeds, focusing purely on algorithm efficiency.
       
       -- Examples of Big O Complexity
            - 3n^2 + 5n → O(n²)
            - n + 100 log n → O(n)
            - 3n³ + 4n⁵ → O(n⁵)
            - 10000 (constant) → O(1)

        --General Rule:
            - Keep only the highest degree term.
            - Ignore constants in Big O notation.

--- Different Notations
        --Theta (Θ) Notation: Exact bound of an algorithm's performance.
        --Omega (Ω) Notation: Lower bound of time complexity.
        --Big O is most commonly used as it defines the upper bound, which is crucial for worst-case analysis.
        --Theta and omega are less frequently used but provide more detailed information about an algorithm performance.
