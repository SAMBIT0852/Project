Programming languages To Know
    Performance speaks louder than words!
    Go → blazing fast, lightweight, and memory efficient * ASP.NET → reliable, enterprise-ready, and steadily catching up
    Node.js → powerful ecosystem, but sometimes weighed down by heavy dependencies
    At the end of the day, there's no "one-size-fits-all" — the best choice depends on project needs, scalability goals, and team expertise.
    What's your go-to backend stack for high-performance

What happens when a server at Netflix dies... while you're binge-watching?
At Netflix scale, failures aren't rare-they're expected.
So how do they make sure your "Next Episode" button never breaks?
They run Chaos Monkey.
It's a tool that deliberately kills servers in production.
Yes, you read that right-Netflix engineers break their own system on purpose.
Why?
Because if your system can survive chaos every day, it will survive real failures too.
Lesson: Reliability isn't about preventing failure.
It's about designing for failure.
Next time you hit "Play" on Netflix, remember: behind that smooth stream is a battlefield of servers constantly failing, recovering, and healing-without you ever noticing.
Would you dare to unleash a Chaos Monkey on your systems?
