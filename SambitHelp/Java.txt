Java Popularity:
	Consistently ranks high in programming indices.
	Widely used in enterprise, mobile, and web development.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine):
	Platform for multiple languages (Kotlin, Scala, Groovy).
	Core Java knowledge facilitates learning other JVM-based languages.

Java Readability and Maintainability:
	Emphasis on Java readability for collaborative coding.
	Maintainability as a key factor for industry adoption.

Key Java Features (Brief Mention):
	Platform independence (WORA - Write Once, Run Anywhere).
	Multithreading.
	Collection API.
	Exception handling.

Java History:
	Created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (James Gosling).
	Acquired by Oracle.
	Regular updates (six-month cycle).

Tools Required:
	JDK (Java Development Kit).
	VS Code (Visual Studio Code) - IDE.
JDK Download:
	Oracle JDK (or other open-source implementations).
	Choosing an LTS (Long Term Support) version (Java 17).
	Platform-specific downloads (Windows, Linux, macOS).


VS Code Download:
	Lightweight and versatile IDE.
	Platform-specific downloads.
JDK Installation (Windows):
	Straightforward installation process.
	Setting the PATH environment variable:
	Locate the bin folder within the JDK installation.
	Add the bin folder path to the system's PATH variable.
	Explanation of the importance of the bin folder, and what the JavaC 	application is.
	Verifying installation: java --version, javac --version in the command 	prompt.

VS Code Installation:
	Simple installation procedure.
	Verifying JDK within VS Code's terminal.
VS Code Initial Setup:
	Choosing a theme.
	Opening a project folder.
	Installing Java extensions (optional, but recommended).

First Java Code:

	Creating a Java File:
	Creating Hello.java within the project folder.
	Importance of the .java extension.
	Using JShell (Java 9+):
	Interactive Java shell for experimentation.
	Demonstrating basic arithmetic and System.out.println().
	Explanation of the system.out.println() command.
	Clarification that Jshell is for testing, not full application 	development.
	Understanding the Java Execution Process:
	JVM (Java Virtual Machine) as the runtime environment.
	Platform independence through JVM.
	Compilation process: Java code to bytecode.
	Java Compiler (javac) role.
	Visual representation of the Java code, JavaC, Bytecode, and JVM.
	The main Method:
	Entry point for Java applications.
	Specific signature: public static void main(String[] args).
	Brief explanation of each keyword in the main method signature.
